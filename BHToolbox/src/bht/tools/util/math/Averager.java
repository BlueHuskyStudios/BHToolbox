 * Averages very many numbers while only using 128 bits of memory (one {@code double} and one {@code long}), maximum, to store
 * the average information. This also allows for a more accurate result than adding all and dividing by the number of inputs.
 * The downside is that you sacrifice speed. As the build-in main method shows, rigorous tests put this method at up to 10
 * times slower. However, when working with a reasonable number of values (up to 1000 values), apeeds are much closer
 * (this is only about 1.5 times slower on average)
 * because there's no chance of an overflow
